# 🔥 Gas Consumption Simulation & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project consists of two parts:
1. **Gas Consumption Simulation** using NetLogo
2. **Time Series Analysis of Gas Consumption** using R

It helps analyze gas usage patterns over time and provides predictive insights using statistical methods.

## 🏗 Setup Instructions
### 🚀 Running the NetLogo Simulation
1. Install **NetLogo** from [official site](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
2. Open `gas_consumption.nlogo` in NetLogo.
3. Click `Setup` to initialize the simulation.
4. Click `Run` to start the simulation.

### 📊 Running the R Time Series Analysis
1. Install R and RStudio.
2. Ensure the following R packages are installed:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "forecast", "tseries"))
   ```
3. Run the script `gas_consumption_analysis.R` in RStudio:
   ```r
   source("gas_consumption_analysis.R")
   ```
